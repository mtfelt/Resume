Introduction to phonological theory and analysis (rules, representations,  
underlying forms, derivations). Emphasis on practical skills with problem 
sets.

**Phonological Theory I** (P)  
Optimality theory in phonological theory. Interaction of phonology with  
morphology and syntax, syllable structure, stress. Graduate level.  

**Directed Research** (A+)

**Advanced Modern Mandarin** (A)  
Materials selected from contemporary Chinese publications, with emphasis

cultural background. Readings, compositions, informal debates on topical  
issues, and oral presentations.  

**Introduction to Classical Chinese** (A+)  
Grammar and readings in selected premodern texts.  

#### Research Experience
I investigated the hypothesis that language immersion aids adult second  
language acquisition by inhibiting the native language. I designed and  
conducted an experiment, and recruited participants. Participants were  
native English speakers learning Mandarin at UCLA, and native English  
speakers that were learning Mandarin in a study abroad program at National  
Taiwan Normal University. Results were statistically significant.
